# Exploration of Semantic Segmentation Applications for Packaging and E-Commerce Content
Files used on term project for SCS_3546_007 Deep Learning - Prof. Sina Jamshidi - April 2020


<b>The Goal</b>
<br>
Consumer packaged products have image retouching requirements such as background removal that are usually delivered by human operators, as seen on examples on the right.
Imagery meant to be distributed to e-commerce sites usually have their background removed or set to white, whereas packaging artwork files require images with a blended background and may be difficult to properly mask.
This project investigates Deep Learning options using semantic and instance segmentation models to automate the process at comparable levels of quality.<br>

<b>Datasets</b><br>
This project uses a subset of the Supervisely Human Dataset (ds1, ds2, ds6) available on https://supervise.ly/
